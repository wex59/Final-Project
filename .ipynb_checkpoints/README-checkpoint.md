Overview:

We believe that the best neighborhood should be the most stable neighborhood, where people can get their basic needs met, feel safe in their surroundings, and have the less traffic. So, we looked at the data that shows the percentage of people with salaries, the crime data, and the traffic data in the neighborhood.
